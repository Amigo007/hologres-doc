Architecture
============


*******************************************
HSAP (Hybrid Serving/Analytics Processing)
*******************************************

Built as unify data storage for unified data service.


*****************************************************
Optimized for Row-based and Column-based Storage
*****************************************************

Supports both row-based and column-based storage. Row-based storage for data serving, and column-based storage for analytics. 

One piece of data in Hologres unifies two set of data infrastructures.


*******************************************
Separating Computation and Storage
*******************************************

Resources are managed and scaled independenyly.


*******************************************
Written in C++
*******************************************

To deliver the ultimate performance!


*******************************************
Ultimate Storage Engine
*******************************************

Completely Asyc
---------------

No Locking
-----------

Lock-free for resources. No waiting on locks, no part to slow you down.


Memory Management
-----------------

Customized memory management with precise control for the ultimate results.


*******************************************
Modern Compute Engine
*******************************************

Custimized Scheduler & High Concurrency
