# Commit Rules

Commit Rules apply to both code and documentation.

Each commit must be submitted in a Pull Request (PR) first, reviewed by a community trusted member, then merge via the PR. No commit can be pushed to repository directly by the ones who have commit priviledge.

The only exception is for initial documentation migration commits.
